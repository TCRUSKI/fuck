Simply just spawn it and type save_ah_shops again.

What do i do if someone deleted a npc ingame?
-If you are admin or above you type /ahmenu in the chat, where a admin menu open where you can respawn the npc's.

Why is the menu purple? 
-Either you forgot to add material into your main directory and run a fastdl sync. 
-Or you forgot to add it to your workshop collection.
